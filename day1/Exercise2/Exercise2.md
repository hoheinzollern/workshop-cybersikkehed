## Exercise 2a
First, we are going to create our very own C program.<br>
If this feels ridiculously easy, go on the hunt in the documentation and find something fun to implement.<br>
* Open your favorite IDE
* Create a new file, 2a.c, then write
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("it works!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
* Now we want to see it in action!
* Open your terminal and write
```shell
gcc 2a.c -o 2a.c
```
* `-o` is a way to compile our code into a specific name.
* Now, you can run the code by writing
```shell
./2a
```
* And so, you've made your first C program.
