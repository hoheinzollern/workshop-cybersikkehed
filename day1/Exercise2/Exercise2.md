# Exercise 2: C programs

Welcome to the 2nd exercise of today. Here, we will learn about the C language, with a focus on how to compile a c program, and how to use conditionals, loops and functions.

<b>Useful links:</b>
* [C documentation](https://devdocs.io/c/)

## Exercise 2a
First, we are going to create our very own C program. 

If this feels ridiculously easy, go on the hunt in the documentation and find something fun to implement.
* Open your favorite IDE
* Create a new file, 2a.c, then write
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("it works!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
* Now we want to see it in action!
* Open your terminal and write
```shell
gcc 2a.c -o 2a.c
```
* `-o` is a way to compile our code into a specific name.
* Now, you can run the code by writing
```shell
./2a
```
* And so, you've made your first C program.


## Exercise 2b
Now, we will jump into some *Conditionals*. If you are familiar with programming, you have probably used them before. 

You will have to finish this piece of code, then compile it and see if it runs correctly You can try this iteratively. If you are unsure what to do, try and write out the code as is in a new file, then compile. What does it say?

## Exercise 2c
We continue with the conditionals, finish the code, compile and review.

## Exercise 2d
For the next two exercises, we are going to handle some *Loops*. Very common and used in most imperative code. Finish, compile, review.

## Exercise 2e
We stay with the loops for another piece. Again fill in the blanks, compile and review. <br>

## Exercise 2f
For the last two exerices, we will tackle some *functions* in C. 

As you've done before, go through the code, see whats missing, fill in the blanks, compile and review.
