# Exercise 1: data representation

Welcome to the first exercise! Let's figure out how data is loaded and stored.

First of all let's look at numbers (integers).
We know they are represented as 0s and 1s, that is so called binary representation.
There are other useful representations, such as hexadecimal, decimal.

## Ex 1:
What is the binary and hex representation of the number `42`?

## Ex 2:
What is the binary representation of the number `32`? and its hex representation?
Convert the following hexadecimal into decimal and representation: `0x435446667477`

## Ex 3:
Look at the ASCII table and convert the following hex number into text:
`59 6F 75 20 73 30 63 6B`

## Ex 4:
Open this file with cutter and find the hexdump tab. Can you find the following hex sequence: `232320457820323a0a57686174206973207468652062696e61727920726570726573656e746174696f6e206f6620746865206e756d62657220603332603f`?
